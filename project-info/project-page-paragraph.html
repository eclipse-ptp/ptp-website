The aim of the parallel tools platform project is to produce an open-source industry-strength 
platform that provides a highly integrated environment specifically designed for parallel application 
development. The project will provide a standard, portable parallel IDE that supports a wide range of 
parallel architectures and runtime systems; a scalable parallel debugger; support for  the integration 
of a wide range of parallel tools; and an enviornment that simplifies the end-user interation with parallel
systems.
