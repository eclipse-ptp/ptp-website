<p>The Eclipse Parallel Tools Platform Release 1.1 (1 Q 2007) requires the base Eclipse platform and Java, the CDT or Photran, and MPI.
<ul>
<li>Java 1.5 or later
<li><b>Eclipse</b> platform: Version  3.2 or later
<li>C or Fortran programming environment.  One of the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> C/C++ Development Toolkit -
Version 3.1 or later 
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/photran/">Photran</a> Eclipse plug-in for Fortran: allows both
Fortran and C/C++ files in projects - version 3.1 or later.
Wherever CDT is mentioned, Photran projects and files, for C/C++, should also work.  
</li> 
</ul>
<li>MPI
- Support for MPI is currently only available using Open MPI version 1.0.2 or 1.2


</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> The PLDT (Parallel Language Development Tools) 
can operate independently of the PTP core plugins.  They do not require Linux or MacOS
and can function on Windows, with MPI systems other than OpenMPI.
  That is, parallel program development with CDT
can operate with PLDT alone.  The PTP runtime and debugger do not currently work with Windows.
