You can view the variables in this areaby selecting the tab on the Variables View<p>  <img src="images/variablesViewSelect.gif"> <p>  Note that most variables don't have valid values  yet since we haven't executed their initializations in theprogram. <p><img src="images/variablesViewDisplay.gif"><h2 id="pSets">Process Sets</h2><p>Traditional debuggers apply operations to a singleprocess.  Parallel debugging operations apply to a single process<i>or to arbitrary collections of processes.</i> <p>A <i>process set </i> is a means of simultaneously referringto one or more processes.<p>When a parallel debug session is first started, all processes are placedin a set, called the 'Root' set.  Sets are always associated with a single Job.A job can have any number of process sets.  A set can contain from 1 to thenumber of processes in a job.<p><img src="images/pSets.gif"><h2 id="pSetsOper">Operations on Process sets</h2><p>Use the icons in the toolbar of the Parallel Debug viewto create, modify, and delete process sets, and to changethe current process set.<br><img src="images/pSetOper.gif"><p>Debug operations on the Parallel Debug View toolbar always apply to the current set.<p><img src="images/pSetDebug.gif"><h3 id="pSetsCreate">Creating Process Sets</h3><ol>  <li>A process set is created by selecting a rectangular region with the mouse,    or click the mouse and shift-click or ctrl-click to     select a contiguous region, or separate processes, respectively</li></ol><p><img src="images/pSetSelect.gif"><ol start=2>  <li>Create a process set from the group that was selected by    clicking on the <i>image</i> in the icon <img src="images/createProcessSetIcon.gif">..  </li></ol><p><img src="images/selectProcessSetCreate.gif"><h3>Adding processes to a set </h3><p>Processes can be added to an existing process set by clicking    on the <img src="images/downArrowSelect.gif"> down-arrow to the right of the icon:  </p><p><img src="images/selectProcessSetCreateAdd.gif"><h3>Changing the current set </h3><p>To change the current process set, select the icon  <img src="images/pSetChooseIcon.gif">  and choose from the list via the down-arrow <img src="images/downArrowSelect.gif">, or     click on the image in the icon itself to cycle through the sets.  </p><p><img src="images/pSetChange.gif"><h3>Removing processes from a set </h3><p>To remove processes from <i>the current set</i>, select the processes as described above, and Click the"Remove Elements" button.<p><img src="images/pSetRemove.gif"><h3>Deleting a process set </h3><p>Select the "Delete Set" icon to delete the current process set.<p><img src="images/pSetDelete.gif"><h2 id="bkpt">Breakpoints</h2><p>There are two main types of parallel breakpoints in PTP.<ul><li><i>Global Breakpoints</i> apply to <i>all</i> processes in <i>any</i> job.They are saved between jobs.</li></ul><p><img src="images/bkptGlobal.gif"></p><ul><li><i>Set Breakpoints </i> apply only to a process in a particular set    (which can include the root set) for a single job. When the job completes,    the breakpoints are no longer available.</li></ul><p>Breakpoints are colored depending on which processes the breakpoint applies to:</p><p><img src="images/bkptSet.gif"></p><ul>  <li>Green indicates the breakpoint set is the same as the current set.    </li>  <li> Blue indicates some processes in the breakpoint set are also in the current set (i.e. the process sets overlap.)</li>  <li> Yellow indicates the breakpoint set is different from the current set.    </li></ul><h3>Setting Breakpoints</h3><p>  To create a set breakpoint, make sure the current job is selected, then double-click on the left edge of   an editor window, at the line on which you want to set the breakpoint.  Or, right click and use the context menu.  </p><p><img src="images/bkptSetContext.gif">  </p><p>To create a global breakpoint, first make sure that  no jobs are selected (click in white part of jobs view if necessary). double-click on the left edge of an editor window.  Note that if a job is selected, the breakpoint will apply to the current set.</p><h3>Breakpoint information</h3><p>Hover over a breakpoint to see more information.<p>  <img src="images/bkptHover.gif"><p>Use the Breakpoints view to see all breakpoints.<p><img src="images/bkptsView.gif"><p>Use the menu in the Breakpoints view to group breakpointsby type.<p><img src="images/bkptsViewMenu.gif"><p>For example the above selection will list the breakpointsby process set.<p><img src="images/bkptsViewByProcessSet.gif"><h2 id="cip">Current Instruction Pointer</h2><p>The current instruction pointer is used to show the currentlocation of <i>suspended</i> processes.In traditional programs, there is a single instruction pointer.(The exception to this is multi-threaded programs.)In parallel programs, there is an instruction pointer for every process.<p>The PTP debugger shows one instruction pointer for<i>every group of processes at the same location</i>.<blockquote><b>Note:</b> The group of processes represented by an instruction pointeris not necessarily the same as a process set.</blockquote><p>In the normal debugger, the single instruction pointeris indicated with the blue arrow icon.  The current source line is also highlighted.<p><img src="images/sip.gif"><p>In the PTP (parallel) debugger, there are multiple instruction pointers.<p><img src="images/mip.gif"><p>  The marker depends on the type of process stopped at that location.<ul><li><img src="images/ipMult.gif">Multiple processes marker<li><img src="images/ipReg.gif">Registered process marker<li><img src="images/ipUnreg.gif">Un-registered process marker</ul><p>Hovering over the instruction pointer provides additional information.<p>  <img src="images/cipHover.gif"><h2 id="reg">Process Registration and the Debug View</h2> <p>Process set commands apply to groups of processes.For finer control and more detailed information, a process can be<i>registered</i> and isolated in the Debug View.<p>Registered processes, including their stack traces, appear in the 'Debug' view.Any number of processes can be registered,and processes can be registered or un-registered at any time.<p>To register a process, double-click its process icon in the Jobs view.Note that the process "diamond" then is surrounded by a box.The process appears in the debug view.<p><img src="images/reg1.gif"><p>To un-register a process, double-click on the same icon.The box disappears, and the process is removed from the debug view.<p>Note that the debug commands (icons including run, step, etc.)in the toolbar of the Jobs view (tab title: Parallel Debug)control the currently selected process set.The debug commands in the toolbar of the Debug view control the single process that is currently selected  in that view.<h2 id="term">Terminating the debug session </h2><p>Click on the terminate icon <img src="images/terminateAll.gif"> in the    Parallel Debug View.  Note that the terminate icon in the Debug (Process)  view <img src="images/terminate.gif">will terminate a single process.</p>    <h2 id="exer">Putting it all together</h2><p>Note that with the above instructions, you should now be able to do the following:<i>Answers are in italics.</i><ul><li>Set a global breakpont<br><i>Make sure no job is selected, then double-click in the area to the left of the source line.
