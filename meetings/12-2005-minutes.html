Introductions and areas of interest</strong></p>  <p><strong>Absoft</strong>:</p>  <p>Interested in tool chain integration for their Fortran compiler and providing FX2 support in the parallel debugger.</p>  <p><strong>Cray</strong></p>  <p>Exploring the possibility of using Eclipse with Cray development tools.</p>  <p><strong>Intel</strong></p>  <p>Interested in integration of IDB with parallel debugger.</p>  <p><strong>IBM</strong></p>  <p>Contributed the MPI development tools to the PTP project. Interested in extending functionality of MPI tools and providing advanced debugging support.</p>  <p><strong>U of Oregon</strong></p>  <p>Interested in integrating their Tuning and Analysis Utilities (TAU)  with Eclipse PTP.</p>  <p><strong>LANL</strong></p>  <p>Focussing on the core parts of PTP: runtime support and parallel debugger. Also interested in Fortran language integration and providing advanced language features such as refactoring. </p>  <p><strong>2. Intro to the Eclipse Foundation &amp; committer process</strong></p>  <p>Greg provided a brief overview of the Eclipse Foundation, its structure and objectives. He also described the process for becoming an Eclipse committer, and the rights and obligations of committers. Beth and Bill discussed their exeperiences from and IBM perspective. </p>  <p><strong>3. PTP status &amp; 1.0 release plans</strong></p>  <p>PTP is currently at RC2. Status of components as follows:</p>  <ul>    <li>FDT - ready, 1 outstanding bug</li>    <li>MPI development tools - ready, some minor issues to be fixed</li>    <li>Runtime - cleanup, some functionality still being added </li>    <li>Debugger - functionality complete</li>    </ul>  <p>A licensing issue was discovered with the debugger. This will necessitate re-implementing a component which will delay the release.</p>  <p>Packaging is still an issue. Java plugins are ok, but a decision on how to package runtime/debugger components still being made. Current thinking is to target a single OpenMPI version and a small number of architectures: Linux &amp; MacOSX.</p>  <p>Currently aiming for Dec 24 release.</p>  <p>Action: Greg to update release plan.   </p>  <p><strong>4. Planning for PTP 1.1</strong></p>  <p>To begin the planning process for 1.1, various organizations outlined the areas that they will be focussing on in the next 6-12 month time-frame. </p>  <p><strong>LANL</strong></p>  <ol>    <li>Remote services, such as build/launch/debug, that will allow PTP to be used on a different machine from the parallel machine running the jobs. </li>    <li>Resource managent: providing an interface (UI/API) to job schedulers  that will allow resource requests and monitoring/notification of allocation status. </li>    <li>Parallel debugger enhancements including: scalability, new UI features, and simplifying integration with other backend debuggers (non-gdb). </li>    <li>Runtime integration: providing standard interfaces to simplify integration with other runtime/monitoring/resource allocation systems.</li>    </ol>  <p><strong>IBM</strong></p>  <ol>    <li>OpenMP tools, similar to those provided for MPI</li>    <li>XLF/XLC tool chain integration</li>    <li>MPI data type support</li>    <li>OpenRTE and remote build issues</li>    <li>Replay/post mortem debugging support</li>    <li>Fortran MPI development tools (longer term)</li>    </ol>  <p><strong>U of Oregon</strong></p>  <ol>    <li>Additional areas for integration of TAU with PTP</li>    <li>Interfaces</li>    <li>Conversion of some exising tools to Java</li>    </ol>  <p><strong>Absoft</strong></p>  <ol>    <li>Integration of the Absoft Fortran complier with the Eclipse Fortran tool chain </li>    </ol>  <p>Action: Greg to develop planning document and post to web.</p>  <p><strong>5. Other business</strong></p>  <p>Beth reminded everyone that there were PTP and Photran paper submissions to EclipseCon 2006. Everyone should vote for these papers to ensure they are accepted.</p>  <p><strong>6. Next meeting</strong></p>  <p>It was decided to hold the next meeting on Tuesday January 10, 2006    </p>  </tr></table></body></html>
