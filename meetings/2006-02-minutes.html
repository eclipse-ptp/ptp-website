    Nathan Debardeleben, LANL <br>
    Craig Rasmussen, LANL <br>
    Gregor, Argonne National Lab  </p>  <p><strong>1. FDT Status</strong></p>  <p>Craig reports the FDT release is fairly static since December.
  Integration with  Photran has caused some problems.
  Currently the FDT is more stable than Photran.
  Craig has added a refactoring action, of refactoring reals to
  double precision.
    <p><strong>2. PTP Team Status</strong></p>
    <p>Nathan is only 1/2 time on PTP now.
    <br>New PTP team member: Randy Roberts from LANL, also 1/2 time. 
    Randy will focus on Job Scheduling systems, and remote systems.
    <p>Will need testers soon for binary build.  Beth and Wyatt volunteered
    for Linux testing.
     <p><strong>3. EclipseCon</strong></p>
     <p><a href="http://eclipseCon.org">EclipseCon</a> is March 20-23, 2006 in Santa Clara, CA.
<ul>
     <li>Greg's PTP "long talk" entitled
     <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Sub.do?id=265">Parallel Application Development With Eclipse</a>
     is Tuesday at 3:15.
     <li>[Addendum Feb. 27] A Demo entitled 
     <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Sub.do?id=507">
     Parallel Tools Platform Demo</a>
     has also been accepted
     and will presented by Beth Tibbitts - Wednesday at 2:00 pm 
     (with a little help from her friends).  Nathan had suggested
     a portable bproc cluster would be good for this?
     
       <li>A BOF (Birds of a Feather) session will be scheduled
     one evening.  Date/Time to be determined.
     <li>CDT Conference is scheduled for Friday March 24.
     <!-- BRT?: these two items -->
     <p>Univ. Houston - CDT changes - Craig/Greg
     <p>Gregor - CoG - Commodity Grid Kit
     </ul>
     <p><strong>3. Parallel Debugger (Greg)</a></strong></p>
     <p>Debugger features being worked onover the next year include:
     <ol>
     <li>Missing CDT functionality - conditional breakpoints, hit counts, signals, memory view, etc.
     <li>Parallel Visualization - e.g. view variables from a range of processes.
     Viewing specific data structions, such as arrays, better.
     <li>MPI-specific debugging: debugger needs knowledge of messages, communicators, etc. 
     </ol>
     <p><strong>4. PTP Scalability (Greg)</a></strong></p>
     <ol>
     <li>Baseline study: how scalable is it now?
     Greg has 256-node cluster, 4 proc per node = 1024 processors.
     Expects o(n) scaling - confirmed.
     Startup was 15 sec.; debug operations were 7 sec per operation.
     This is comparable to TotalView for 1K processes.
     <li>Plans: (a) take advantage of MPI collectives e.g. broadcast communication, to control
     debug processes more effiently.
     <br>(b) add a process hierarchy so don't need to scan across all processes.  Want to scale to 10K+ processes.
     
     </ol>
      <p><strong>4. Current PTP release</a></strong></p>
       <p> Builds should be ready this week; Release should be shortly after that.
      <p>Target pre-reqs:
      <ul>
      <li>Java 1.4
      <li>CDT 3.0.x
      <li>Eclipse 3.1
      </ul>
       <p><strong>5. TAU plug-in (Wyatt)</a></strong></p>
       <a href="http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php">TAU</a> (Tuning and Analysis Utilities)
        plug-in should be available soon.
      <p><strong>5. Miscellaneous</a></strong></p>
      <p>Next meeting March 14
