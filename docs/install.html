<h1>Installing Eclipse and PTP</h1>
<p>To install the "light" version of Eclipse for PTP, the CDT, and then PTP, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Download the "Platform" version of Eclipse, not the "SDK" version
         e.g. go to the <a href="http://eclipse.org/downloads">
          Eclipse downloads site</a>.
<br>Under the Second "Download now" link click on the smaller "Other downloads for 3.2.2."
          <br>On the next page scroll down to the heading "Platform Runtime Binary" and download the tar (or zip) file for your platform.
          This is about 1/3 to 1/4 the size of the full SDK, and doesn't include the Java or Eclipse Plug-in development parts, which I assume you don't need.
           The UI is simpler since you don't have all those additional options.
         <br>The Eclipse SDK works just fine, though, if you prefer that.
         </li>   
         <p>
<li>Download the CDT as well.
       You can do this from the Eclipse UI as follows:
       <ol type="a">
       <li>Help > Software Updates > Find and Install...    
       <br><img src="images/install1_softwareUpdates.gif">
       <p>
       <li>Select "Search for new features to install", 
       <br><img src="images/install2_searchForNewFeatures.gif">
       <p>
       <li>Click Next, Select "Callisto Discovery Site" and click "Finish."
       <br>(The Callisto discovery site lists Eclipse plug-ins guarateed to work with the 3.2 version of Eclipse.)
       <br><img src="images/install3_Callisto.gif">
       <p>
       <li> When the Callisto Update site is loaded you see another Dialog. 
       <br>Expand the "Callisto Discovery Site" item and check the "C and C++ Development" item.

        <p>
        <li>Click Next, accept the license terms, Click Next, and click Finish.
        <li>On the Verification page, click "Install All."
        <li>When it's done, click "Yes" to restart the Eclipse workbench.  Or click "no" and close it down to install PTP.
                        </ol>
                        <p>
<li>To download and install PTP,   close Eclipse, download PTP and PLDT from the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ptp/downloads.php">PTP downloads page.</a>
        and follow the instructions in the "release notes and installation instructions" link.
        </ol>
