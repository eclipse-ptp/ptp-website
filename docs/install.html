<h1>Installing Eclipse and PTP</h1>
<p>To install Eclipse, the CDT, and then PTP, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Download either the "light" (platform) version of Eclipse or the full   "SDK" version:
          go to the <a href="http://eclipse.org/downloads">
          Eclipse downloads site</a> and then do one of the following:
          <ul type="a"> 
          <li>For the "light" version, under the Second "Download now" link, click on the smaller "Other downloads for 3.2.2."
          <br>On the next page scroll down to the heading "Platform Runtime Binary" and download the tar (or zip) file for your platform.
          This is about 1/3 to 1/4 the size of the full SDK, and doesn't include the Java or Eclipse Plug-in development parts, which I assume you don't need.
           The UI is simpler since you don't have all those additional options.
          
          <li> The Eclipse SDK works just fine, though, if you prefer that.
          On the main downloads page, you should be able to click on 
          "Download now: Eclipse SDK 3.x.x" and download it on the next page.
         </li> 
          </ul>
  	      After downloading and extracting Eclipse (zip or tar file), there's nothing
  	      else to the installation process. 
  	      In the extracted folder, simply double-click the eclipse executable file.
         <p>
<li>Download the CDT as well.
       You can do this from the Eclipse UI as follows:
       <ol type="a">
       <li>Help > Software Updates > Find and Install...    
       <br><img src="images/install1_softwareUpdates.gif">
       <p>
       <li>Select "Search for new features to install", 
       <br><img src="images/install2_searchForNewFeatures.gif">
       <p>
       <li>Click Next, Select "Callisto Discovery Site" and click "Finish."
       <br>(The Callisto discovery site lists Eclipse plug-ins guarateed to work with the 3.2 version of Eclipse.)
       <br><img src="images/install3_Callisto.gif">
       <p>
       <li> When the Callisto Update site is loaded you see another Dialog. 
       <br>Expand the "Callisto Discovery Site" item and check the "C and C++ Development" item.
                       
                      
        <br><img src="images/install4_CDT.gif">
        <p>
        <li>Click Next, accept the license terms, Click Next, and click Finish.
        <li>On the Verification page, click "Install All."
        <li>When it's done, click "Yes" to restart the Eclipse workbench.  Or click "no" and close it down to install PTP.
        <p>
        <li>Note: the above installs the runtime version of CDT. If you intend to develop
        plug-ins with CDT, be sure to get the full SDK version.
        <br>The CDT SDK <i>as well as the runtime</i> are available from the CDT Update Site
        (as opposed to the Callisto discovery site mentioned above).
        The CDT Update Site is available by entering the following URL
        as the Remote Site in the Update Manager. 
        <ul><li>http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/callisto
        </li></ul>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
<li>To download and install PTP,   close Eclipse, download PTP and PLDT from the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ptp/downloads.php">PTP downloads page.</a>
        and follow the instructions in the <a href="releases/release-1.1.php">release notes and installation instructions</a> page.
        </ol>
