It is based on the CDT/CDI Debug Model. PTP Debug Core acts as a bridge between the Platform Debug Model and PTP Debug External which is connected to the external debugger interface. </li>  <li>An extension to CDI called PCDI which is suitable for the parallel debug model is shared between PTP Debug Core and PTP Debug External. With CDI and PCDI, the external component (PTP Debug External) can be further extended or replaced without rewriting the core component (PTP Debug Core).</li>  <li> A process debug model which is inherited from the PTP Core Process Model.

Events from multiple processes can be aggregated into one event. The event system utilizes BitList to avoid overwhelming the platform with events.</li>  <li> Breakpoint management system for multiple processes. Unlike in the CDT Debug Model where a breakpoint is associated with a single process, in PTP Debug Model, a breakpoint is associated with the debug session. Thus, a single breakpoint can be applied to a set of processes.</li>  <li>A support to see the variables in the Variable view for selected processes in the Debug view.</li>  <li>A well-defined interface (IDebugger) in PTP Debug External to be used by external debuggers to connect to PTP. The interface is similar to the HPDF standard albeit without command-line support (e.g. command history, debug focus).</li>  <li>A simulated parallel debugger as an example of implementation of IDebugger.
